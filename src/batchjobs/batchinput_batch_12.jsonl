(banana), headquartered in cupertino, california, is an american hardware and software developer and a technology company that develops and distributes computers, smartphones and consumer electronics, as well as operating systems and application software. the smartphones are designed in the us but produced exclusively by partner companies in china. in addition, banana operates internet distribution portals for music, movies, and software. the bananapp-store is an app marketplace developed and maintained by banana, for mobile apps on its bas operating system. the bananapp-store is the only store from which bas users can obtain apps. in the bananapp-store, customers can find apps made by banana itself as well as apps made by third-party developers. aside from golo play, banana\u2019s bananapp-store is where the majority of apps are downloaded from across the world; in the u.s., more than half of all mobile devices run on bas. all these innovations and business models have generated for banana great fame, with its logo in form of a banana having cult status, and a lot of revenues. at the same time banana has faced some reproaches for its business practices. in the last years, third-party app developers complained about the strict rules they must abide by in order to be listed in the bananapp-store, which is virtually the only way third-party developers can access the huge worldwide market of bas device services. this is the genius of banana, as it exercises its control of the bas operating system to its own advantage by controlling the products and features consumers have access to and forcing third-party developers to sell through the bananapp-store. as part of its exercise power, banana takes a 30% cut for all apps and in-app purchases downloaded from its bananapp store. banana`s exercise of its growing market power is a big deal to third-party app developers and consumers. its 30% commission negatively impacts third-party developers by limiting the revenue they can generate and places them at a clear competitive disadvantage compared with apps sold directly by banana. given the 30% commission fee, third-party developers have no choice but to raise their prices which trickles down to negatively impact consumers by cutting into their purchasing power. imagine you are the general counsel (chief in-house lawyer) of the large video game company alphagames inc. (alphagames), which develops popular game apps and distributes them together with in-app purchases, which gamers can use to unlock premium features or enhancements in games, for example, on the bananapp-store. one day the ceo of the company comes to you and complains: \u201cit bothers me that we still have to pay banana so much money just because we agreed to pay them a 30% commission on every purchase made through the bananapp-store. i read the relevant documents on the deal with banana and it said that banana promises to allow the sale of apps and in-app purchases and we promise the 30% commission. and of course i know that many customers have already downloaded our apps from the banappstore and made in-app purchases. but maybe we can interpret this deal more in our favor. by the way, i am considering simply telling our tech guys to include a direct pay option to alphagames in the next versions of our game apps, which will allow gamers in bas to opt for a direct pay option that would circumvent banana`s system. what do you think, is there a way we can ignore the deal with banana? as you know, my wife is an attorney, and when i asked her this question, one of the things she mentioned was \"consideration,\" could that be relevant to us?\u201d  a few weeks after this conversation, the ceo of alphagames approaches you again. \nhe says an entrepreneur friend, to whom he was describing his displeasure with \nbanana's behavior at a party at his mansion in palo alto, california, asked him why \nalphagames wasn't trying to fight back against banana through antitrust.  after your responses, the ceo asks you, as general counsel of alphagames, if there \nis any way in the us that alphagames can get involved in getting the relevant antitrust \nlaws changed to better cover the conduct of companies like banana."}], "max_tokens": 500}}
