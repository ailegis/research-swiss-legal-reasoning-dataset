that athena private hospital can put its\nsavings in rent into lowering the prices of its medical services.\nathena private hospital has a good reputation in the local community and is

more likely to survive childbirth at athena private hospital than in the public\nhospitals of rose.\na few weeks ago, an incident came to light that led to an uproar in the local community. a\nlocal pregnant mother was brought into athena private hospital by her neighbour, where she\nwas admitted for labour. the woman lives within 10 minutes from a public hospital, but she\nchose the more distant athena private hospital because she would have needed to pay for the\nmedicine to induce labour at a public hospital, despite tulipa\u2019s national policy for all public\nhealthcare facilities to offer free maternity care as one of the country\u2019s implementation\nmeasures under cedaw. it is for this reason that many women risk a longer journey to go to\nathena private hospital. if they have to pay for maternity services anyways, they reason, it is\nbetter to do it at a hospital with a higher rate of maternal and infant survival.\nupon her arrival at athena private hospital, the pregnant woman, known as m, was not\nphysically checked or monitored by any athena private hospital nurse. the nurses told m\nthat if she needed medical attention, she would have to walk to the delivery room by herself.\nwhen m\u2019s labour started, no nurse came to help. m walked alone in great pain to the delivery\nroom, where she found that all the beds were taken. she turned around and tried to find a\nnurse. unable to continue walking, m fell and gave birth on the floor, in full and open view of\neveryone in the hallway. she lost consciousness.\n3\nupon finding m on the floor unconscious, two nurses slapped and shouted at m repeatedly. m\ndoesn\u2019t remember any of this, but the abuse was captured by an athena private hospital staff,\nwho filmed the whole ordeal on his mobile phone. once m regained consciousness, she was\nordered to go back to the delivery room to be examined. m was released with her baby the\nnext day, but she suffered severe emotional distress as result of her

that athena private hospital can put its\nsavings in rent into lowering the prices of its medical services.\nathena private hospital has a good reputation in the local community and is widely\nconsidered to provide better care than the public hospitals of rose. this is seen in the\nmaternal and infant mortality numbers for the province of rose, where mothers and their\nchildren are more likely to survive childbirth at athena private hospital than in the public\nhospitals of rose.\na few weeks ago, an incident came to light that led to an uproar in the local community. a\nlocal pregnant mother was brought into athena private hospital by her neighbour, where she\nwas admitted for labour. the woman lives within 10 minutes from a public hospital, but she\nchose the more distant athena private hospital because she would have needed to pay for the\nmedicine to induce labour at a public hospital, despite tulipa\u2019s national policy for all public\nhealthcare facilities to offer free maternity care as one of the country\u2019s implementation\nmeasures under cedaw. it is for this reason that many women risk a longer journey to go to\nathena private hospital. if they have to pay for maternity services anyways, they reason, it is\nbetter to do it at a hospital with a higher rate of maternal and infant survival.\nupon her arrival at athena private hospital, the pregnant woman, known as m, was not\nphysically checked or monitored by any athena private hospital nurse. the nurses told m\nthat if she needed medical attention, she would have to walk to the delivery room by herself.\nwhen m\u2019s labour started, no nurse came to help. m walked alone in great pain to the delivery\nroom, where she found that all the beds were taken. she turned around and tried to find a\nnurse. unable to continue walking, m fell and gave birth on the floor, in full and open view of\neveryone in the hallway. she lost consciousness.\n3\nupon finding m on the floor unconscious, two nurses slapped and shouted at m repeatedly. m\ndoesn\u2019t remember any of this, but the abuse was captured by an athena private hospital staff,\nwho filmed the whole ordeal on his mobile phone. once m regained consciousness, she was\nordered to go back to the delivery room to be examined. m was released with her baby the\nnext day, but she suffered severe emotional distress as result of her delivery at athena private\nhospital.\nthe treatment that m received at the hospital also caused resentment in the local community,\nwhich has a large population of indigenous people. m and her family are of indigenous\norigin, and m wore her distinct indigenous clothing on the day of the delivery. local residents\nbelieve that m\u2019s origin is the only explanation for why she was singled out for such treatment.\nthe case also tapped into longstanding resentment by the local indigenous community against\napollo joint venture. they allege that apollo joint venture did not consult with the local\nindigenous community on any aspect of the mining operation and that there is simply no\nrespect shown by apollo joint venture for their distinct culture and way of life.\nlocal residents were

union. zeus\nminerals is the majority shareholder of the apollo joint venture seated in tulipa, which\nmines for tin in tulipa. with the growing demand for tin in the global electronics industry,\ntulipa has seen an economic upturn. however, the economic benefits have not been\ndistributed evenly. the local community around the apollo joint venture, located in the\nprovince of rose, has extremely poor public infrastructures. this is particularly seen in the\ndire state of rose\u2019s roads, hospitals, schools, police stations and other public facilities.\na few years ago, zeus minerals began to be more sensitive about its public image and media\nrelations. zeus minerals recently pledged to invest more to improve the living conditions of\nlocal residents in rose, many of whom are miners at the apollo joint venture and members of\nthe miners\u2019 families. for instance, zeus minerals supports a private hospital in rose, named\nathena private hospital, by allowing it to rent a building on the property of the apollo joint\nventure for a price extremely below the market rate. zeus minerals also pays for the building\noperating costs (maintenance and cleaning), so
